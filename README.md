# Industrial-Copper-Modeling

## Introduction:

* This project focuses on modelling industrial copper data using Python and various libraries such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn.
* The objective of the project is to preprocess the data, handle missing values, detect outliers, and handle skewness. 
* Additionally, regression and classification models will be built to predict the selling price and determine if a sale was won or lost.
* The trained models will be saved as a pickle file for later use in a Streamlit application.
